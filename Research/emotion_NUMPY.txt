Row 0: Prefrontal Control (Cognitive Regulation)
Brain regions: Prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex

What it does:

Regulates emotional intensity
Reappraises situations ("It's not that bad")
Inhibits inappropriate responses
Makes decisions about emotional expression

Columns:

pythonrow_0 = [
    current_intensity,      # 0.0-1.0: How strong is emotion RIGHT NOW
    regulation_strength,    # 0.0-1.0: How much are we suppressing/amplifying it
    reappraisal_capacity,   # 0.0-1.0: Ability to reinterpret situation (high = resilient)
    inhibition_level        # 0.0-1.0: How much we're holding back expression
]




Row 1: Physiological Response (Body State)
Brain regions: Amygdala, hypothalamus, brainstem, autonomic nervous system
What it does:

Controls physical responses (heart rate, sweating, tension)
Prepares body for action (fight/flight/freeze)
Creates "gut feelings"
Drains or provides energy

Columns:
pythonrow_1 = [
    arousal_level,      # 0.0-1.0: General physiological activation (calm → intense)
    heart_rate_analog,  # 0.0-1.0: Cardiovascular response (0.5 = baseline)
    muscle_tension,     # 0.0-1.0: Physical tension (0 = relaxed, 1 = rigid)
    energy_state        # 0.0-1.0: Available energy (0 = depleted, 1 = energized)
]






Row 2: Expression/Communication (External Display)
Brain regions: Motor cortex, facial nerve nucleus, insula
What it does:

Controls facial expressions
Modulates voice tone and volume
Drives body language (posture, gestures)
Sends social signals to others

Columns:
pythonrow_2 = [
    facial_intensity,   # 0.0-1.0: How much is showing on face (0 = poker face, 1 = very expressive)
    vocal_expression,   # 0.0-1.0: Voice tone/volume modulation (0 = flat, 1 = highly expressive)
    body_language,      # 0.0-1.0: Posture/gesture intensity (0 = still, 1 = animated)
    social_signal       # 0.0-1.0: Overall communicativeness (0 = hidden, 1 = broadcasting)
]

# Pride (showing off)
[0.8, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9]  # Big smile, confident voice, open posture, clearly broadcasting

# Shame (hiding it)
[0.2, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1]  # Neutral face, quiet voice, closed posture, hiding feeling

# Anger (trying not to show it)
[0.4, 0.3, 0.6, 0.3]  # Some tension visible, controlled voice, tense posture, somewhat hiding








Row 3: Reward/Motivation System (Dopamine)
Brain regions: Ventral tegmental area (VTA), nucleus accumbens, ventral striatum
What it does:

Evaluates reward value of situation
Creates expectations about outcomes
Detects prediction errors (better/worse than expected)
Drives approach (move toward) or avoidance (move away)

Columns:
pythonrow_3 = [
    reward_value,         # 0.0-1.0: How rewarding is this situation (0 = punishing, 0.5 = neutral, 1 = highly rewarding)
    expectation,          # 0.0-1.0: What we expected to happen (for comparison)
    prediction_error,     # -1.0 to +1.0: Actual - Expected (negative = disappointed, positive = pleasantly surprised)
    approach_tendency     # 0.0-1.0: Drive to approach (1.0) or avoid (0.0)
]
Example values:
python# Pride (exceeded expectations, want more)
[0.9, 0.5, 0.4, 0.9]  # High reward, expected medium, positive surprise, strong approach

# Disappointment (worse than expected)
[0.2, 0.7, -0.5, 0.3]  # Low reward, expected high, negative surprise, weak approach

# Fear (potential threat, avoid)
[0.1, 0.5, -0.4, 0.1]  # Negative outcome, expected neutral, bad surprise, strong avoidance
